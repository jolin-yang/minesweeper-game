# Minesweeper Game 

## Features:
🚩 Flagging: Right-click cells to flag cells you suspect to be mines.
#️⃣ Neighboring cell count: When a non-mine cell is clicked, reveals the number of mines neighboring that cell.
🌊 Floodfill effect: Recursively reveals all adjacent non-mine cells in a cascading flood-like manner when a non-mine cell with zero neighboring mines is clicked, uncovering an entire region of connected non-mine cells until it reaches a cell with a non-zero neighboring mine count.
🔄 Restart: Restarts the game with a new layout of mines when the return key is clicked after the current game is won/loss.






Objective: Uncover all non-mine cells in the grid without clicking on/"setting off" any mines
