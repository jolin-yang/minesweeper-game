# Minesweeper Game 

## Features:
üö© **Flagging**: Right-click cells to flag cells you suspect to be mines.   
#Ô∏è‚É£ **Neighboring mine count**: When a non-mine cell is clicked, reveals the number of mines neighboring that cell.   
üåä **Floodfill effect**: Recursively reveals all adjacent non-mine cells in a cascading flood-like manner when a non-mine cell with zero neighboring mines is clicked, uncovering an entire region of connected non-mine cells until it reaches a cell with a non-zero neighboring mine count.   
üìä **Stats panel**: Bottom panel displaying player stats, including length of the current game, number of remaining mines to be uncovered, number of cells that have been uncovered, number of remaining (non-mine) cells  to be uncovered.   
üîÑ **Restart**: Restarts the game with a new layout of mines when the return key is clicked after the current game is won/loss.   



##  Instructions:
***Game Objective***: Uncover all non-mine cells in the grid **WITHOUT** clicking on/"setting off" any mines.    

- Each cell in the grid represents either a mine or non-mine (safe) cell, with mines randomly distributed across the grid. 

- At the beginning of the game, the first cell the player clicks on is always guaranteed to be a non-mine cell. It is impossible for the player to immediately lose after their first click per the design of the game.  

- Click on a non-mine cell to see the number of mines adjacent to it - and make sure you don't click on any mine, otherwise the mine will be set off and the game will be over. This a game of logic, so make use of the  neighboring mine count values to infer which cells are mines and which are non-mine cells that are safe to click on.   

- Flag cells you suspect to be mines by right-clicking them.  

- As you play the game, view the bottom panel to see your player stats and use these to help you determine how many more mines you have left to track and how many non-mine cells you need to uncover:  
  - The length of the current game so far
  - The number of mines that remain to be uncovered  
  - The number of cells that have been uncovered  
  - The number of (non-mine) cells that remain to be uncovered  

- Once the current game has ended, you can restart the game with a new layout of mines by pressing the return/enter key. Note: this **only** works once the game is over and will not work midway through a game.   

- Use the source code to customize the grid dimensions and number of mines (default settings are 16 √ó 30 with 99 mines):     
Grid must have 9‚Äì35 columns and up to 17 rows.
