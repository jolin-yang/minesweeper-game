# Minesweeper Game 

## Overview
Inspired by the classic Minesweeper game, my project preserves the core game mechanics while introducing a unique twist with functional supporting features designed to enhance gameplay and user experience. Enjoy!


## Features
üö© **Flagging**: Right-click cells to flag cells you suspect to be mines.   

#Ô∏è‚É£ **Neighboring mine count**: When a non-mine cell is clicked, reveals the number of mines neighboring that cell.  

üåä **Floodfill effect**: Recursively reveals all adjacent non-mine cells in a cascading flood-like manner when a non-mine cell with zero neighboring mines is clicked, uncovering an entire region of connected non-mine cells until it reaches a cell with a non-zero neighboring mine count.   

üìä **Stats panel**: Bottom panel displaying player stats, including length of the current game, number of remaining mines to be uncovered, number of cells that have been uncovered, number of remaining (non-mine) cells  to be uncovered.   

üîÑ **Restart**: Restarts the game with a new layout of mines when the return key is clicked after the current game is won/loss.   



##  Instructions
***Game Objective***: Uncover all non-mine cells in the grid **WITHOUT** clicking on/"setting off" any mines.    

- Each cell in the grid represents either a mine or non-mine (safe) cell, with mines randomly distributed across the grid. 

- At the beginning of the game, the first cell the player clicks on is always guaranteed to be a non-mine cell. It is impossible for the player to immediately lose after their first click per the design of the game.  

- Click on a non-mine cell to see the number of mines adjacent to it - and make sure you don't click on any mine, otherwise the mine will be set off and the game will be over. This is a game of logic, so make use of the  neighboring mine count values to infer which cells are mines and which are non-mine cells that are safe to click on.   

- Flag cells you suspect to be mines by right-clicking them.  

- As you play the game, view the bottom panel to see your player stats:  
  - The length of the current game so far
  - The number of mines that remain to be uncovered  
  - The number of cells that have been uncovered  
  - The number of (non-mine) cells that remain to be uncovered

  Use these stats to help you determine how many more mines you have left to track and how many more non-mine cells you need to uncover.

- Once the current game has ended, you can restart the game with a new layout of mines by pressing the return/enter key.   
**Note**: This **only** works once the game is over and will not work midway through a game.   

- Use the source code to customize the grid dimensions and number of mines (default settings are 16 √ó 30 with 99 mines).     
**Note**: Grid must have 9‚Äì35 columns and up to 17 rows.
