# Minesweeper Game 

## Features:
🚩 **Flagging**: Right-click cells to flag cells you suspect to be mines.   
#️⃣ **Neighboring cell count**: When a non-mine cell is clicked, reveals the number of mines neighboring that cell.   
🌊 **Floodfill effect**: Recursively reveals all adjacent non-mine cells in a cascading flood-like manner when a non-mine cell with zero neighboring mines is clicked, uncovering an entire region of connected non-mine cells until it reaches a cell with a non-zero neighboring mine count.   
🔄 **Restart**: Restarts the game with a new layout of mines when the return key is clicked after the current game is won/loss.   


##  Instructions:
*** Game Objective: Uncover all non-mine cells in the grid WITHOUT clicking on/"setting off" any mines***
